We live in a noisy world where sounds generated by humans or animals sometimes can indicate distress.
The Importance of Distress Detection Humanitarian
Early detection of distress signals means faster rescues, reduced pain and trauma, and better outcomes for victims.
Medical Distress signals can indicate acute and chronic medical conditions. Early detection can lead to faster interventions and better outcomes.
Safety Distress signals in public areas can indicate threats to safety and security. Timely alerts can help mitigate risks and preventÂ disasters
